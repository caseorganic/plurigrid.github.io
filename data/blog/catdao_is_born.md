# Why Microgrids?

Microgrids are defined by the presence of an inverter device and circuit, which allows for the microgrid to have sovereignty over the power frequency. 

Inverters leave the grid reliability in the hands of the microgrid operators (the inverter circuits allow for that to be realizable within a seperate view than the macrogrid. 

## What does a simulation look like?

''A simulation onsists of two things:''
A public good portion (licensed under MIT public license) in the most general sense simulations or tokenomics or augmented bonding curve that allows for the growth of the inecnetive mechanism to be associated with the growth of the microgrid or a group of microgrids coorporating together. 

* This augmented bonding curve has a special term that includes into the token issueance schedule the phtysical properties that are derived from the modelling of the distributed energy resources as made possible by NREL SIIP framework (scallable inetegrated infrastructure planning model) and the GenX expansion model by MIT's Energy Initiative.  

''Visualization Dashboard''
* A resulting output in a form of a dashboard with a number of customizable sliders for the paramers of the curve that microgrid househould energy product designer or user of the simulation can customized that then show the possible futures in terms of grid expansion and resilience
